TI  - Guidelines for Genome-Scale Analysis of Biological Rhythms.

AB  - Genome biology approaches have made enormous contributions to our understanding of 
      biological rhythms, particularly in identifying outputs of the clock, including 
      RNAs, proteins, and metabolites, whose abundance oscillates throughout the day. 
      These methods hold significant promise for future discovery, particularly when 
      combined with computational modeling. However, genome-scale experiments are costly 
      and laborious, yielding "big data" that are conceptually and statistically difficult 
      to analyze. There is no obvious consensus regarding design or analysis. Here we 
      discuss the relevant technical considerations to generate reproducible, 
      statistically sound, and broadly useful genome-scale data. Rather than suggest a set 
      of rigid rules, we aim to codify principles by which investigators, reviewers, and 
      readers of the primary literature can evaluate the suitability of different 
      experimental designs for measuring different aspects of biological rhythms. We 
      introduce CircaInSilico, a web-based application for generating synthetic genome 
      biology data to benchmark statistical methods for studying biological rhythms. 
      Finally, we discuss several unmet analytical needs, including applications to 
      clinical medicine, and suggest productive avenues to address them.

TI  - Chrononutrition and Polyphenols: Roles and Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/nu11112602 [doi]
LID - 2602
AB  - Biological rhythms can influence the activity of bioactive compounds, and at the 
      same time, the intake of these compounds can modulate biological rhythms. In this 
      context, chrononutrition has appeared as a research field centered on the study of 
      the interactions among biological rhythms, nutrition, and metabolism. This review 
      summarizes the role of phenolic compounds in the modulation of biological rhythms, 
      focusing on their effects in the treatment or prevention of chronic diseases. 
      Heterotrophs are able to sense chemical cues mediated by phytochemicals such as 
      phenolic compounds, promoting their adaptation to environmental conditions. This is 
      called xenohormesis. Hence, the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in 
      phenolic compounds exerts several health benefits, mainly attributed to the product 
      of their metabolism. However, the profile of phenolic compounds present in plants 
      differs among species and is highly variable depending on agricultural and 
      technological factors. In this sense, the seasonal consumption of polyphenol-rich 
      fruits could induce important changes in the regulation of physiology and metabolism 
      due to the particular phenolic profile that the fruits contain. This fact highlights 
      the need for studies that evaluate the impact of these specific phenolic profiles on 
      health to establish more accurate dietary recommendations.

AB  - Most processes of human body, such as brain function, are regulated by biological 
      rhythms. Disturbance of biological rhythms impairs mood, behavior, cognition, sleep, 
      and social activity and may lead to mental disorders. Disturbed rhythms are widely 
      observable in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and make risk of onset, 
      comorbidity, response of antidepressants, recurrence, cognition, social function, 
      and complications of physical health. Therefore, it is crucial to assess and manage 
      focus on biological rhythms for patients with MDD. There are several validated ways 
      of assessing the biological rhythms, including 24 h fluctuations in cortisol or 
      melatonin, sleep monitoring, actigraphy, and self-report scales. Chronotherapy, such 
      as cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, sleep 
      deprivation, and bright light therapy was widely reported for treatment in patients 
      with MDD. Monoamine antidepressants and lithium are attributed to regulation of 
      biological rhythm. And some rhythm-regulated agents have been shown efficacy of 
      antidepressant. Considering the crucial clinical significance of disturbed 
      biological rhythms in MDD, we describe the mechanisms, clinical features, 
      measurements, and treatments of the biological rhythms in patients with MDD.

AB  - Biological rhythms, from circadian control of cellular processes to annual cycles in 
      life history, are a main structural element of biology. Biological rhythms are 
      considered adaptive because they enable organisms to partition activities to cope 
      with, and take advantage of, predictable fluctuations in environmental conditions. A 
      flourishing area of immunology is uncovering rhythms in the immune system of 
      animals, including humans. Given the temporal structure of immunity, and rhythms in 
      parasite activity and disease incidence, we propose that the intersection of 
      chronobiology, disease ecology, and evolutionary biology holds the key to 
      understanding host-parasite interactions. Here, we review host-parasite interactions 
      while explicitly considering biological rhythms, and propose that rhythms: influence 
      within-host infection dynamics and transmission between hosts, might account for 
      diel and annual periodicity in host-parasite systems, and can lead to a 
      host-parasite arms race in the temporal domain.

AB  - Sustained oscillations abound in biological systems. They occur at all levels of 
      biological organization over a wide range of periods, from a fraction of a second to 
      years, and with a variety of underlying mechanisms. They control major physiological 
      functions, and their dysfunction is associated with a variety of physiological 
      disorders. The goal of this review is (i) to give an overview of the main rhythms 
      observed at the cellular and supracellular levels, (ii) to briefly describe how the 
      study of biological rhythms unfolded in the course of time, in parallel with studies 
      on chemical oscillations, (iii) to present the major roles of biological rhythms in 
      the control of physiological functions, and (iv) the pathologies associated with the 
      alteration, disappearance, or spurious occurrence of biological rhythms. Two tables 
      present the main examples of cellular and supracellular rhythms ordered according to 
      their period, and their role in physiology and pathophysiology. Among the rhythms 
      discussed are neural and cardiac rhythms, metabolic oscillations such as those 
      occurring in glycolysis in yeast, intracellular Ca(++) oscillations, cyclic AMP 
      oscillations in Dictyostelium amoebae, the segmentation clock that controls 
      somitogenesis, pulsatile hormone secretion, circadian rhythms which occur in all 
      eukaryotes and some bacteria with a period close to 24 h, the oscillatory dynamics 
      of the enzymatic network driving the cell cycle, and oscillations in transcription 
      factors such as NF-ΚB and tumor suppressors such as p53. Ilya Prigogine's concept of 
      dissipative structures applies to temporal oscillations and allows us to unify 
      within a common framework the various rhythms observed at different levels of 
      biological organization, regardless of their period and underlying mechanism.

AB  - Biological rhythms are a fundamental property of life. The deep ocean covers 66% of 
      our planet surface and is one of the largest biomes. The deep sea has long been 
      considered as an arrhythmic environment because sunlight is totally absent below 
      1,000 m depth. In the present study, we have sequenced the temporal transcriptomes 
      of a deep-sea species, the ecosystem-structuring vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus. 
      We reveal that tidal cycles predominate in the transcriptome and physiology of 
      mussels fixed directly at hydrothermal vents at 1,688 m depth at the Mid-Atlantic 
      Ridge, whereas daily cycles prevail in mussels sampled after laboratory acclimation. 
      We identify B. azoricus canonical circadian clock genes, and show that oscillations 
      observed in deep-sea mussels could be either a direct response to environmental 
      stimulus, or be driven endogenously by one or more biological clocks. This work 
      generates in situ insights into temporal organisation in a deep-sea organism.

AB  - The methyl cycle is a universal metabolic pathway providing methyl groups for the 
      methylation of nuclei acids and proteins, regulating all aspects of cellular 
      physiology. We have previously shown that methyl cycle inhibition in mammals 
      strongly affects circadian rhythms. Since the methyl cycle and circadian clocks have 
      evolved early during evolution and operate in organisms across the tree of life, we 
      sought to determine whether the link between the two is also conserved. Here, we 
      show that methyl cycle inhibition affects biological rhythms in species ranging from 
      unicellular algae to humans, separated by more than 1 billion years of evolution. In 
      contrast, the cyanobacterial clock is resistant to methyl cycle inhibition, although 
      we demonstrate that methylations themselves regulate circadian rhythms in this 
      organism. Mammalian cells with a rewired bacteria-like methyl cycle are protected, 
      like cyanobacteria, from methyl cycle inhibition, providing interesting new 
      possibilities for the treatment of methylation deficiencies.

AB  - Animals, plants, and microorganisms exhibit numerous biological rhythms that are 
      generated by numerous biological clocks. This article summarizes experimental data 
      pertinent to the often-ignored issue of integration of multiple rhythms. Five 
      contexts of integration are discussed: (i) integration of circadian rhythms of 
      multiple processes within an individual organism, (ii) integration of biological 
      rhythms operating in different time scales (such as tidal, daily, and seasonal), 
      (iii) integration of rhythms across multiple species, (iv) integration of rhythms of 
      different members of a species, and (v) integration of rhythmicity and physiological 
      homeostasis. Understanding of these multiple rhythmic interactions is an important 
      first step in the eventual thorough understanding of how organisms arrange their 
      vital functions temporally within and without their bodies.

AB  - Affective disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorders and seasonal 
      affective disorders have been described as alterations of various neuronal systems. 
      In addition to the classical monoaminergic hypotheses that have been long proposed 
      to explain the pathophysiology of these disorders, a strong association between 
      circadian rhythms and mood regulation has been suggested in the light of several 
      clinical and preclinical findings. In this review, we summarize the different 
      hypotheses on pathophysiology mechanisms underlying depressive disorders and put a 
      special emphasis on the alterations of melatonin secretion and associated changes in 
      biological rhythms that characterize mood disorders. Causal relationships between 
      alterations in circadian rhythms and mood disorders are strongly supported by the 
      antidepressant efficacy of innovative pharmacological treatments aimed at 
      resynchronizing endogenous rhythms in depressed patients. Genetic, epigenetic and 
      environmental factors generating desynchronization between endogenous biological 
      rhythms and exogenous rhythms driven by environmental and societal constraints are 
      very probably involved in the vulnerability to mood disorders. Further 
      investigations of the molecular/cellular bases of the relationships between stress 
      axis dysfunctions, endogenous biological rhythm dysregulations and associated 
      functional and anatomical brain alterations should allow important progress in the 
      knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms of affective disorders and the downstream 
      development of innovative, more effective and better tolerated, therapies.

AB  - Knowledge of biological rhythms has led to better understanding of the time-of-day 
      dependent effects of anaesthetic drugs. These chronopharmacological effects are 
      currently explained by the biological rhythms modulating the pharmacokinetic, toxic 
      and pharmacodynamic parameters of these substances. Such effect has been described 
      for general anesthetics, local anaesthetics, analgesics as well as for antibiotics. 
      But recent data also highlight that general anaesthetics, probably part of their 
      brain effects, also alter the regulation of biological rhythms, including the 
      sleep-wake or the endogenous circadian temperature rhythms. This desynchronization 
      of biological rhythms can led to disturbance of the circadian secretion of many 
      substances, including hormones. Finally, biological rhythms have been also described 
      with regard to physiology of pain and cardiovascular physiopathology. The concept of 
      biological rhythm should be present in mind not only for the clinical management of 
      patients but also for setting studies in the field of anaesthesia, pain and 
      intensive care.

AB  - This article is part of a Journal of Biological Rhythms series exploring analysis 
      and statistical topics relevant to researchers in biological rhythms and sleep 
      research. The goal is to provide an overview of the most common issues that arise in 
      the analysis and interpretation of data in these fields. In this article, we address 
      issues related to the collection of multiple data points from the same organism or 
      system at different times, since such longitudinal data collection is fundamental to 
      the assessment of biological rhythms. Rhythmic longitudinal data require additional 
      specific statistical considerations, ranging from curve fitting to threshold 
      definitions to accounting for correlation structure. We discuss statistical analyses 
      of longitudinal data including issues of correlational structure and stationarity, 
      markers of biological rhythms, demasking of biological rhythms, and determining 
      phase, waveform, and amplitude of biological rhythms.

AB  - Integration of several approaches concerning time and temporality can enhance the 
      pathophysiological study of major mood disorders of unknown etiology. We propose 
      that these conditions might be interpreted as disturbances of temporal profile of 
      biological rhythms, as well as alterations of time-consciousness. Useful approaches 
      to study time and temporality include philological suggestions, phenomenological and 
      psychopathological conceptualizatíons, clinical descriptions, and research on 
      circadian and ultradían rhythms, as well as nonlinear dynamics approaches to their 
      analysis.

TI  - The Comparison of the Biological Rhythms of Patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome with 
      Biological Rhythms of Healthy Controls.
PG  - e920462
LID - 10.12659/MSM.920462 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a rheumatic disease characterized by 
      diffuse body pain and decreased muscle function. The aim of the present study was to 
      compare the biological rhythms of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome with the 
      biological rhythms of healthy controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a 
      cross-sectional, single blind, and single center case-control study. The patients 
      with fibromyalgia were evaluated using a Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), 
      Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) Scale, Visual 
      Analog Scale (VAS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Beck Depression 
      Inventory (BDI). RESULTS The study included 77 female patients with FMS, and 32 
      healthy female individuals as the control group. We found that the patients in the 
      FMS group achieved higher scores in VAS, BDI, PSQI, and the BRIAN scale than the 
      patients in the control group (P<0.001). An evaluation of the relationship between 
      FMS evaluation parameters and biological rhythm scores in patients with FMS revealed 
      a significant positive correlation between total BRAIN and VAS, FIQ, BDI, and PSQI 
      scores. When the relationship between FMS evaluation parameters and biological 
      rhythm scores was evaluated in patients with FMS, a significant positive correlation 
      was found between total BRAIN and VAS, FIQ, BDI, and PSQI scores (r=0.555, P<0.001; 
      r=0.461, P<0.001; r=0.630, P<0.001; and r=0.551, P<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS 
      We consider that an evaluation of the biological rhythm of female patients with FMS, 
      and appropriate treatment when required, would contribute significantly to the 
      treatment and follow-up process of the patients.

TI  - Light and biological rhythms.
PG  - 5-19
AB  - Chronobiology--derived from chronos (time), bios (life), and logos (study of)--is 
      the objective description of biological time structures and plays an important role 
      in medicine. Circadian rhythms regulate the behaviour, physiology and function of 
      living organisms at many biochemical levels. The influence of the rhythmic 
      manifestation of life may be shown in the constructive effects of growth, 
      development and maturation and is named anachronobiology. In contrast 
      catachronobiology denotes deleterious effects of time and rhythm which may lead to a 
      diseased state. This article summarizes some new data about light as a synchronizer 
      of biological rhythms. A time-keeper--biological clock--is used by the body for 
      readjustment of rhythms when this is desirable. More recently, light has been used 
      to adjust the biological clock following changes of circadian rhythms during shift 
      work or jet lag occurring when flying from one time zone to another. Light may be 
      used to treat depression, sleep disorders, menstrual dysregulations and other 
      illnesses with disturbed circadian and seasonal rhythms. Examples of the importance 
      of chronopharmacology (time-dependent changes in drug metabolism and drug effect) 
      are also presented. New findings indicate that circadian oscillators are under 
      genetic control; a light-influenced regulatory role for cellular immediate-early 
      genes in circadian behaviour has been discovered. This suggests that light is of 
      importance in regulation of macromolecular synthesis at all levels of the circadian 
      system.

TI  - Analysing Biological Rhythms in Fibromyalgia Syndrome.
PG  - 241-4
LID - 10.7727/wimj.2014.366 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study evaluated biological rhythm disorders in patients with fibromyalgia 
      syndrome (FMS). METHODS: The study enrolled 82 patients with FMS and 82 controls. 
      Pain intensity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The psychological 
      conditions of the patients were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). 
      The Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) was used 
      to assess disturbances in biological rhythms (ie sleep, activity, social and eating 
      patterns). RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups at baseline (all 
      p > 0.05). The BDI, BRIAN total, sleep, activity, social, and eating scores were 
      higher in patients with FMS than in the controls (all p < 0.001). Further, a 
      significant correlation was found between biological rhythms and BDI scores (p < 
      0.001) and there were positive correlations between the VAS score and BRIAN total, 
      sleep, and eating and BDI in patients with FMS (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There 
      are marked biological rhythm disturbances in FMS. There is an important relationship 
      between rhythm disorders and FMS. The disturbances in sleep, functional activities, 
      social participation, and disordered rhythms like eating patterns show the need for 
      a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with FMS.

TI  - Chronopharmacognosy.
PG  - 6-15
LID - 10.4103/0973-7847.95852 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to review the concept of biological rhythms in medicinal plants. 
      Dictionariesgenerally define pharmacognosy as the subject of the study of crude 
      drugs of plant and animal origin. The name is derived from the Greek words pharmakon 
      (drug) and gnosis (knowledge). Today pharmacognosy is also defined as the study of 
      physical, chemical, biochemical and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, 
      or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin, as well as the search for 
      new drugs from natural sources. Also, another important phenomenon to be taken care 
      of in the production of therapeutic compounds in medicinal plants is the use of 
      circardian clock. The circardian clock is studied by chronobiology, which can be 
      defined as a field of science that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living 
      organisms and their adaptation to solar and lunar related rhythms. Thus, it is the 
      scientific study of the effect of time on living systems and of biological rhythms. 
      Also rhythmic oscillations in plants lead to the enormous production of particular 
      compounds in plants at particular time, which may or may not produce any therapeutic 
      effect in humans. Thus, the study of chronobiology and pharmacognosy can be put 
      together as chronopharmacognosy.

AB  - Organisms that live on the Earth are subjected to environmental variables that 
      display cyclic variations, such as light, temperature and tides. Since these cyclic 
      changes in the environment are constant and predictable, they have affected 
      biological evolution through selecting the occurrence of biological rhythms in the 
      physiology of all living organisms, from prokaryotes to mammals. Biological clocks 
      confer organisms an adaptive advantage as they can synchronize their behavioral and 
      physiological processes to occur at a given moment of time when effectiveness and 
      success would be greater and/or the cost and risk for organisms would be lower. 
      Among environmental synchronizers, light has been mostly widely studied to date. 
      However, other environmental signals play an important role in biological rhythms, 
      especially in aquatic animals like fish. This review focuses on current knowledge 
      about the role of nonphotic synchronizers (temperature, food and tidal cycles) on 
      biological rhythms in fish, and on the entrainment of the fish circadian system to 
      these synchronizers.

TI  - Resource competition shapes biological rhythms and promotes temporal niche 
      differentiation in a community simulation.
PG  - 11322-11334
LID - 10.1002/ece3.6770 [doi]
AB  - Competition for resources often contributes strongly to defining an organism's 
      ecological niche. Endogenous biological rhythms are important adaptations to the 
      temporal dimension of niches, but how other organisms influence such temporal niches 
      has not been much studied, and the role of competition in particular has been even 
      less examined. We investigated how interspecific competition and intraspecific 
      competition for resources shape an organism's activity rhythms.To do this, we 
      simulated communities of one or two species in an agent-based model. Individuals in 
      the simulation move according to a circadian activity rhythm and compete for limited 
      resources. Probability of reproduction is proportional to an individual's success in 
      obtaining resources. Offspring may have variance in rhythm parameters, which allow 
      for the population to evolve over time.We demonstrate that when organisms are 
      arrhythmic, one species will always be competitively excluded from the environment, 
      but the existence of activity rhythms allows niche differentiation and indefinite 
      coexistence of the two species. Two species which are initially active at the same 
      phase will differentiate their phase angle of entrainment over time to avoid each 
      other. When only one species is present in an environment, competition within the 
      species strongly selects for niche expansion through arrhythmicity, but the addition 
      of an interspecific competitor facilitates evolution of increased rhythmic amplitude 
      when combined with additional adaptations for temporal specialization. Finally, if 
      individuals preferentially mate with others who are active at similar times of day, 
      then disruptive selection by intraspecific competition can split one population into 
      two reproductively isolated groups separated in activity time.These simulations 
      suggest that biological rhythms are an effective method to temporally differentiate 
      ecological niches and that competition is an important ecological pressure promoting 
      the evolution of rhythms and sleep. This is the first study to use ecological 
      modeling to examine biological rhythms.

TI  - The relationship between bipolar disorder and biological rhythms.
PG  - e323-31
LID - 10.4088/JCP.13r08507 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhythm disruption is a core feature of bipolar disorder and it has been 
      hypothesized that disturbances of the circadian timing system play a fundamental 
      role in the etiology of the disorder. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate (1) 
      theoretical models for biological rhythm disruptions in bipolar disorder, (2) 
      physiological disturbances of biological rhythms in bipolar disorder, (3) clinical 
      and therapeutic implications of biological rhythm disturbances in bipolar disorder, 
      and (4) associations between circadian gene variations and bipolar disorder. DATA 
      SOURCES: PubMed database was searched systematically for articles that were 
      published on or before May 5, 2013, and were written in English using the terms 
      bipolar disorder, clock genes, endogenous clock, molecular clock, biological 
      rhythms, circadian, suprachiasmatic nucleus, circadian rhythm, melatonin, and sleep. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Seventy-four articles highlighting the objectives were included in 
      the review. DATA EXTRACTION: Data regarding exploring the association between 
      bipolar disorder and circadian and chronobiological phenomena were reviewed and 
      findings summarized. RESULTS: The literature reviewed suggests that circadian rhythm 
      disturbance may be a feature of bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: In toto, the 
      literature suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be a feature of bipolar 
      disorder. This area of research has received theoretical consideration as playing a 
      significant role in the pathophysiology of the illness but has been understudied to 
      this point. Further research in the field is warranted.

AB  - Biological rhythms play an important role in the regulation of many different 
      physiological systems, including the reproductive system. The 24-hour clock system 
      plays a role in regulating the production, release, synthesis and action of 
      reproductive hormones and in the timing of critical events in the ovarian cycle. 
      Research into the importance of biological rhythms on human reproduction is just 
      beginning, future work is likely to reveal new and unexpected ways in which these 
      rhythms affect human reproduction.

AB  - Biological rhythms are crucial phenomena that are perfect examples of the adaptation 
      of organisms to their environment. A considerable amount of work has described 
      different types of biological rhythms (from circadian to ultradian), individual 
      differences in their patterns and the complexity of their regulation. In particular, 
      the regulation and maturation of the sleep-wake cycle have been thoroughly studied. 
      Its desynchronization, both endogenous and exogenous, is now well understood, as are 
      its consequences for cognitive impairments and health problems. From a completely 
      different perspective, psychoanalysts have shown a growing interest in the rhythms 
      of psychic life. This interest extends beyond the original focus of psychoanalysis 
      on dreams and the sleep-wake cycle, incorporating central theoretical and practical 
      psychoanalytic issues related to the core functioning of the psychic life: the 
      rhythmic structures of drive dynamics, intersubjective developmental processes and 
      psychic containment functions. Psychopathological and biological approaches to the 
      study of infantile autism reveal the importance of specific biological and 
      psychological rhythmic disturbances in this disorder. Considering data and 
      hypotheses from both perspectives, this paper proposes an integrative approach to 
      the study of these rhythmic disturbances and offers an etiopathogenic hypothesis 
      based on this integrative approach.

AB  - Disruptions of circadian rhythms are described in affective disorders, including 
      unipolar and bipolar disorder, but also seasonal affective disorder. Sleep-wake and 
      hormone circadian rhythms are among the most quoted examples. Depression could be 
      conceptualized as a desynchronization between the endogenous circadian pacemaker and 
      the exogenous stimuli, such as sunlight and social rhythms. Accordingly, Clock genes 
      have been studied and the literature suggests that variants in these genes confer a 
      higher risk of relapse, more sleep disturbances associated with depression, as well 
      as incomplete treatment response. Most of therapeutic interventions in depression 
      have an impact on biological rhythms. Some of them exclusively act via a biological 
      pathway, such as sleep deprivation or light therapy. Some psychosocial interventions 
      are specifically focusing on social rhythms, particularly in bipolar disorder, in 
      which the promotion of stabilization is emphasized. Finally, all antidepressant 
      medications could improve biological rhythms, but some new agents are now totally 
      focusing this novel approach for the treatment of depression.

TI  - Why life oscillates--biological rhythms and health.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - A multitude of biological rhythms have been identified in the whole organism as well 
      as within each living cell. Some of these rhythms reflect adaptations to our 
      environment, while others run on their own. Recent evidence shows that these rhythms 
      and their interaction might be more important not only for recreation but also for 
      our health. Disturbance of the circadian rhythms by jet lag or shift work not only 
      disturbs our metabolic balance but also increases the incidence of cancer. Rhythms 
      in the organism obviously stabilize systemic functions: They increase organismic 
      stability by calibrating the system's characteristics. Regulation curves in time and 
      space are crucial for controlling physiological long-term stability. To be 
      continuously aware of its properties an autopetic system may vary its parameters 
      slightly over several time scales at different frequencies--akin to what our body 
      does, e.g. in heart-rate variability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is known that sleep disturbance has been considered a trait-marker of 
      mood disorders. However, the role of disruptions in biological rhythms, such as 
      eating, activity, and social patterns, needs to be better understood. AIM: To assess 
      the differences in biological rhythms in subjects with bipolar disorder, major 
      depressive disorder, and healthy controls. We also tested the association between 
      disruptions of biological rhythms and circadian preferences. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional, population-based study with a representative sample of 1023 young 
      adults. Bipolar disorder and depression were diagnosed using The Mini International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview - PLUS and DSM Structured Clinical Interview. 
      Self-reported biological rhythms and circadian preference were assessed using the 
      Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). RESULTS: 
      Bipolar disorders and depression subjects presented higher rates of disruption in 
      biological rhythms when compared to healthy controls even after adjusting for sex, 
      socioeconomic status, alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, anxiety disorder and 
      psychotropic medication use. Euthymic subjects showed higher biological rhythm 
      disruption when compared to controls. Higher disruption in biological rhythms was 
      observed in subjects with evening preferences. CONCLUSION: Higher disruption in 
      biological rhythms occurs in individuals with depression and bipolar disorder even 
      on periods of euthymia.

TI  - [Aging and biological rhythms in primates].
PG  - 279-83
AB  - All living organisms exhibit rhythmic activities in a wide variety of endocrine and 
      behavioural parameters. These biological rhythms are endogenously generated by a 
      circadian clock, and they are entrained by cyclic variations of environmental 
      factors called synchronizers. Aging is associated with changes in amplitude and 
      temporal organization of many daily and seasonal rhythms. In humans, daily rhythms 
      of sleep, thermoregulation and hormonal secretion are severely altered with aging. 
      Except in humans, studies on primates are scarce. However, age-related effects on 
      biological rhythms are relatively consistent among primate species studied to date, 
      including humans. Therefore, non human primates are of valuable use for such 
      investigations. Most studies have been performed on the Rhesus macaque (longevity 
      35-40 years) and on the gray mouse lemur (longevity 10-12 years). Like in humans, 
      the rest-activity rhythm becomes fragmented in aged primates, and shows an increased 
      activity during the resting period. Aging induces a decrease in amplitude of the 
      body temperature rhythm and an increase in energy consumption. Various hormonal 
      secretions exhibit a decrease with aging, but the rhythmic components of these 
      declines have not always been depicted. Moreover, changes (amplitude or phase) in 
      daily variations depended of the hormonal secretion tested. Taken together, these 
      results suggest that the biological clock in the brain would be a primary target of 
      aging. The main central clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the 
      hypothalamus whose endogenous oscillations are entrained by light. In this brain 
      structure, cellular function and sensitivity to light show drastic changes with age 
      in the mouse lemur. The precise knowledge of age-related alterations of biological 
      rhythms in primates can have important consequences on the development of new 
      treatments to maintain or restore biological rhythmicity in the elderly.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the disruption in biological rhythms and 
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) in individuals with depressive episode. This was a 
      cross-sectional, population-based study with a representative sample of 905 young 
      adults. Current depressive episode were confirmed by a psychologist using the Mini 
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-Plus. Self-reported biological 
      rhythms were assessed using the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in 
      Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). MetS was defined using modified NCEP/ATPIII criteria. 
      Significant main effects of current depressive episode (p<0.001, η(2)=0.163) and 
      MetS (p=0.001, η(2)=0.011) were observed on total BRIAN score. There was a 
      significant interaction between depression and MetS in total biological rhythm 
      scores (p=0.002, η(2)=0.011) as well as sleep (p=0.001, η(2)=0.016) and social 
      domains (p<0.001, η(2)=0.014). In the depressive group, subjects with MetS had a 
      higher disruption in total BRIAN scores (p=0.010), sleep domain (p=0.004), social 
      domain (p=0.005) and in the eating pattern domain approached the level of 
      significance (p=0.098), when compared to subjects with no MetS. The results of the 
      present study showed that self-reported disruptions in biological rhythms are 
      associated with key components of the MetS in community adults with MDD. The 
      understanding of the complex interactions between biological rhythms, MetS and 
      depression are important in the development of preventive and therapeutic 
      strategies.

TI  - Biological rhythms: the science of chronobiology.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - Biological rhythms are an essential component of homoeostasis: 'everything is 
      rhythmic unless proved otherwise'. Circadian (ca 24 h) rhythms are driven by an 
      internal clock situated in the hypothalamus. Without time cues, they deviate from 24 
      h and assume a periodicity of, on average, 24.3 h. Periodicity is inherited, and 
      progress has recently been made in identifying 'clock' genes. Circadian rhythms are 
      synchronised to the 24-h day mostly by light-dark cycles and social time cues. 
      Suitably timed bright light and the pineal hormone melatonin will change the timing 
      of circadian rhythms and can be used to treat biological rhythm disorders, whether 
      occupational or pathological. Rhythm disorder is usually manifested as sleep 
      problems, but some major pathology (eg cardiovascular disease) is associated with 
      frequent rhythm disruption as found in shift workers. Menstrual cycle variations are 
      clearly of importance, and even human seasonality must be taken into consideration. 
      Many drugs show rhythmic variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
      Exploitation of this phenomenon, together with underlying target tissue sensitivity, 
      is underway.

AB  - Biological rhythms appear to be an elegant solution to the challenge of coordinating 
      activities with the consequences of the Earth's daily and seasonal rotation. The 
      genes and molecular mechanisms underpinning circadian clocks in multicellular 
      organisms are well understood. In contrast, the regulatory mechanisms and fitness 
      consequences of biological rhythms exhibited by parasites remain mysterious. Here, 
      we explore how periodicity in parasite traits is generated and why daily rhythms 
      matter for parasite fitness. We focus on malaria (Plasmodium) parasites which 
      exhibit developmental rhythms during replication in the mammalian host's blood and 
      in transmission to vectors. Rhythmic in-host parasite replication is responsible for 
      eliciting inflammatory responses, the severity of disease symptoms, and fueling 
      transmission, as well as conferring tolerance to anti-parasite drugs. Thus, 
      understanding both how and why the timing and synchrony of parasites are connected 
      to the daily rhythms of hosts and vectors may make treatment more effective and less 
      toxic to hosts.

TI  - Biological rhythms: a neglected factor of variability in pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 1099-108
AB  - Biological rhythms may influence drug response (chronopharmacology) and some 
      chronopharmacological studies have underlined the influence of time of day on drug 
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The aim of the present review is to underline 
      how biological rhythms may interfere with drug kinetics and to try to underline 
      when, how, and why taking into account the moment of administration of a drug. Many 
      physiological factors, possibly implicated in different steps of the fate of drugs 
      in the organism (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) vary 
      along the 24 h scale. Taking into account biological rhythms in kinetic studies, 
      should be indicated when the concerned drug will be used in a chronobiological 
      disease (e.g., asthma, cancer, depression, hypertension, gastrointestinal diseases, 
      rheumatisms), etc. In case of a drug characterised by a high inter- and 
      intra-variability, a narrow therapeutic range or when the drug will be further used 
      following a once-a-day formulation. It is of importance to rigorously control 
      factors which are known to influence pharmacokinetic processes in chronokinetic 
      studies. Time of day has to be regarded as an additional variable to influence the 
      kinetics of a drug.

AB  - This article is part of a Journal of Biological Rhythms series exploring analysis 
      and statistics topics relevant to researchers in biological rhythms and sleep 
      research. The goal is to provide an overview of the most common issues that arise in 
      the analysis and interpretation of data in these fields. In this article on time 
      series analysis for biological rhythms, we describe some methods for assessing the 
      rhythmic properties of time series, including tests of whether a time series is 
      indeed rhythmic. Because biological rhythms can exhibit significant fluctuations in 
      their period, phase, and amplitude, their analysis may require methods appropriate 
      for nonstationary time series, such as wavelet transforms, which can measure how 
      these rhythmic parameters change over time. We illustrate these methods using 
      simulated and real time series.

AB  - The Journal of Biological Rhythms will be publishing articles exploring analysis and 
      statistical topics relevant to researchers in biological rhythms and sleep research. 
      The goal is to provide an overview of the most common issues that arise in the 
      analysis and interpretation of data in these fields. By using case examples and 
      highlighting the pearls and pitfalls of statistical inference, the authors will 
      identify and explain ways in which experimental scientists can avoid common 
      analytical and statistical mistakes and use appropriate analytical and statistical 
      methods in their research. In this first article, we address the first steps in 
      analysis of data: understanding the underlying statistical distribution of the data 
      and establishing associative versus causal relationships. These ideas are then 
      applied to sample size, power calculations, correlation testing, differences between 
      description and prediction, and the narrative fallacy.

      challenges.

LID - 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2009.09.005 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that disrupted temporal organization impairs behavior, 
      cognition, and affect; further, disruption of circadian clock genes impairs 
      sleep-wake cycle and social rhythms which may be implicated in mental disorders. 
      Despite this strong evidence, a gap in understanding the neural mechanisms of this 
      interaction obscures whether biological rhythms disturbances are the underlying 
      causes or merely symptoms of mental disorder. Here, we review current understanding, 
      emerging concepts, gaps, and opportunities pertinent to (1) the neurobiology of the 
      interactions between circadian oscillators and the neural circuits subserving higher 
      brain function and behaviors of relevance to mental health, (2) the most promising 
      approaches to determine how biological rhythms regulate brain function and behavior 
      under normal and pathological conditions, (3) the gaps and challenges to advancing 
      knowledge on the link between disrupted circadian rhythms/sleep and psychiatric 
      disorders, and (4) the novel strategies for translation of basic science discoveries 
      in circadian biology to clinical settings to define risk, prevent or delay onset of 
      mental illnesses, design diagnostic tools, and propose new therapeutic strategies. 
      The review is organized around five themes pertinent to (1) the impact of molecular 
      clocks on physiology and behavior, (2) the interactions between circadian signals 
      and cognitive functions, (3) the interface of circadian rhythms with sleep, (4) a 
      clinical perspective on the relationship between circadian rhythm abnormalities and 
      affective disorders, and (5) the pre-clinical models of circadian rhythm 
      abnormalities and mood disorders.

AB  - Biological rhythms are pervasive in nature, yet our understanding of the molecular 
      mechanisms that govern timing is far from complete. The rapidly emerging research 
      focus on epigenetic plasticity has revealed a system that is highly dynamic and 
      reversible. In this Opinion, I propose an epigenetic clock model that outlines how 
      molecular modifications, such as DNA methylation, are integral components for timing 
      endogenous biological rhythms. The hypothesis proposed is that an epigenetic clock 
      serves to maintain the period of molecular rhythms via control over the phase of 
      gene transcription and this timing mechanism resides in all cells, from unicellular 
      to complex organisms. The model also provides a novel framework for the timing of 
      epigenetic modifications during the lifespan and transgenerational inheritance of an 
      organism.

TI  - [Biological rhythms and drugs].
PG  - 11-20
AB  - Precise, rhythmic, daily change of the internal milieu is a conspicuous feature of 
      all living organisms. It affects the temporal patterns of all kinds of behaviors 
      during a day and deeply influences both the social structure and daily life of 
      individual human beings. These daily variations arise from the internal circadian 
      mechanisms. Three functions of the endogenous clock are discriminated; rhythm 
      generation, entrainment to light-dark cycle and output from the clock. The 
      endogenous clock is localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. 
      Interestingly, recent papers demonstrated the widespread expression (hippocampus, 
      cerebellum and also peripheral body) of clock genes such as mPer1 and mPer2 
      (homologs of the Dorsophila period gene). In this review, I describe the cellular 
      mechanisms of circadian oscillation, entrainment and output. Serotonergic drugs and 
      melatonin affect the light and non light-induced entrainment, and lithium and 
      estrogen change the oscillation. Thus drugs can regulate the circadian oscillation, 
      entrainment and outputs. Therefore, I mention the possibility that CNS drugs are 
      useful to keep physiological homeostasis through their action on biological rhythms.

AB  - The adjustment of all species, animals and plants, to the Earth's cyclic 
      environments is ensured by their temporal organisation. The relationships between 
      parasites, vectors and hosts rely greatly upon the synchronisation of their 
      biological rhythms, especially circadian rhythms. In this short note, parasitic 
      infections by Protozoa and by microfilariae have been chosen as examples of the 
      dependence of successful transmission mechanisms on temporal components.

AB  - Properties of the circadian and annual timing systems are expected to vary 
      systematically with latitude on the basis of different annual light and temperature 
      patterns at higher latitudes, creating specific selection pressures. We review 
      literature with respect to latitudinal clines in circadian phenotypes as well as in 
      polymorphisms of circadian clock genes and their possible association with annual 
      timing. The use of latitudinal (and altitudinal) clines in identifying selective 
      forces acting on biological rhythms is discussed, and we evaluate how these studies 
      can reveal novel molecular and physiological components of these rhythms.

TI  - The association between biological rhythms, depression, and functioning in bipolar 
      disorder: a large multi-center study.
PG  - 102-108

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between biological rhythms and severity of 
      depressive symptoms in subjects with bipolar disorder and the effects of biological 
      rhythms alterations on functional impairment. METHOD: Bipolar patients (n = 260) and 
      healthy controls (n = 191) were recruited from mood disorders programs in three 
      sites (Spain, Brazil, and Canada). Parameters of biological rhythms were measured 
      using the Biological Rhythms Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), an interviewer 
      administered questionnaire that assesses disruptions in sleep, eating patterns, 
      social rhythms, and general activity. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of covariance 
      showed significant intergroup differences after controlling for potential 
      confounders (Pillai's F = 49.367; df = 2, P < 0.001). Depressed patients had the 
      greatest biological rhythms disturbance, followed by patients with subsyndromal 
      symptoms, euthymic patients, and healthy controls. Biological rhythms and HAMD 
      scores were independent predictors of poor functioning (F = 12.841, df = 6, 
      P < 0.001, R(2)  = 0.443). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a dose-dependent association 
      between the severity of depressive symptoms and degree of biological rhythms 
      disturbance. Biological rhythms disturbance was also an independent predictor of 
      functional impairment. Although the directionality of this relationship remains 
      unknown, our results suggest that stability of biological rhythms should be an 
      important target of acute and long-term management of bipolar disorder and may aid 
      in the improvement of functioning.

AB  - In this chapter, we present a series of four articles derived from a Introductory 
      Workshop on Biological Rhythms presented at the 72nd Annual Cold Spring Harbor 
      Symposium on Quantitative Biology: Clocks and Rhythms. A diverse range of species, 
      from cyanobacteria to humans, evolved endogenous biological clocks that allow for 
      the anticipation of daily variations in light and temperature. The ability to 
      anticipate environmental variation promotes optimal performance and survival. In the 
      first article, Introduction to Chronobiology, we present a brief historical timeline 
      of how circadian concepts and terminology have emerged since the early observation 
      of daily leaf movement in plants made by an astronomer in the 1700s. Workshop Part 
      IA provides an overview of the molecular basis for rhythms generation in several key 
      model organisms, Workshop Part IB focuses on how biology built a brain clock capable 
      of coordinating the daily timing of essential brain and physiological processes, and 
      Workshop Part IC gives key insight into how researchers study sleep and rhythms in 
      humans.

AB  - The relationships between biological rhythms and human aggressive behavior are 
      addressed and discussed in this article: First, circadian rhythms and aggression are 
      considered. Studies of sleep/waking cycle disturbances in aggression are reported. 
      Severe aggression is associated with profound changes in sleep architecture. Causal 
      link is difficult to establish given that sleep disturbance and aggressive behavior 
      could be the symptoms of the same disorder. Specific aggressive behavior developed 
      during sleep is also described. In addition, hormonal circadian rhythm studies are 
      reported. Thus, low cortisol levels, in particular low cortisol variability, are 
      associated with aggressive behavior, suggesting an inhibitory role of cortisol. 
      Testosterone has daily and seasonal fluctuations, but no link with aggression has 
      been established. Neurophysiological underlying mechanisms are discussed in the last 
      part of this article, with a focus on the relationship between brain rhythm and 
      aggression. Increase of slow-wave EEG activities is observed in individuals with 
      aggressive behavior. Epilepsy, as a disease of brain rhythm could be associated with 
      aggressive behavior, in pre, post and inter ictal periodes. Incidence of aggression 
      is not likely more prevalent in epileptic individuals compared to those with other 
      neurological conditions. Ictal changes take the form of profound behavioral changes, 
      including aggressive behavior which has been interpreted as the emergence of 
      "archeical" or innate motor patterns. In this multidisciplinary approach, the main 
      difficulty is the categorization of the differents types of aggression. Finally, 
      taken together, these studies suggest that biological rhythms, especially circadian 
      rhythms, could provide therapeutic benefits to human aggressive behavior. Biological 
      rhythymicity seems to be a necessary permanent training offering interesting 
      perspectives for the adaptation to changes in the field of aggression.

TI  - Analyzing biological rhythms in clinical trials.
PG  - 720-6
LID - 10.1016/j.cct.2008.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The human body exhibits a variety of biological rhythms. There are 
      patterns that correspond, among others, to the daily wake / sleep cycle, a yearly 
      seasonal cycle and, in women, the menstrual cycle. Sine/cosine functions are often 
      used to model biological patterns for continuous data, but this model is not 
      appropriate for analysis of biological rhythms in failure time data. METHODS: We 
      consider a method appropriate for analysis of biological rhythms in clinical trials. 
      We present a method to provide an estimate and confidence interval of the time when 
      the minimum hazard is achieved. A motivating example from a clinical trial of 
      adjuvant of pre-menopausal breast cancer patients provides an important illustration 
      of the methodology in practice. RESULTS: Adapting the Cosinor method to the Weibull 
      proportional hazards model is proposed as useful way of modeling the biological 
      rhythm data. It presents a method to estimate the time that achieves the minimum 
      hazard along with its associated confidence interval. The application of this 
      technique to the breast cancer data revealed that the optimal day for pre-resection 
      incisional or excisional biopsy of 28-day cycle (i.e. the day associated with the 
      lowest recurrence rate) is day 8 with 95% CI 5-10. We found that older age, fewer 
      positive nodes, smaller tumor size, and experimental treatment are important 
      prognostic factors of longer relapse-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of 
      biological/circadian rhythms is usually handled by Cosinor rhythmometry method. 
      However, in FTD this is simply not possible. In this case, we propose to adapt the 
      Cosinor method to the Weibull proportional hazard model. The advantage of the 
      proposed method is its ability to model survival data. This method is not limited to 
      breast cancer data, and may be applied to any biological rhythms linked to right 
      censored data.
